# 🧮 Numerical Analysis Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of numerical analysis problems from my coursework at **Stony Brook University**. These problems were implemented using Java and focus on applying numerical techniques to solve mathematical equations where analytical solutions are difficult or impossible.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of how theoretical algorithms can be implemented practically to solve real-world numerical problems. I gained experience writing clean, modular code and debugging math-heavy scripts.

## 📎 Notes

- All implementations were done without using external numerical libraries (unless required), to build algorithms from scratch and understand core logic.
- For educational use only.
